# EdTech Glossary of Terms
*Tracking key concepts in Educational Technology and Digital Learning Systems.*

## Core Infrastructure
* **LMS (Learning Management System):** Software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses (e.g., Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard).
* **SIS (Student Information System):** A management information system for education establishments to manage student data (e.g., grades, attendance, history).
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** The protocol that allows different software components (like an LMS and an SIS) to communicate and share data.

## Standards & Protocols
* **SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model):** A set of technical standards for e-learning software products. It tells programmers how to write their code so that it can "play well" with other e-learning software.
* **xAPI (Experience API / Tin Can):** The successor to SCORM that allows for the tracking of learning experiences everywhere (offline, mobile, games), not just inside an LMS.

## Pedagogy & Design
* **Asynchronous Learning:** Learning that allows students to access materials and complete work at their own pace and time.
* **Blended Learning:** An education style that combines online educational materials and opportunities for interaction online with traditional place-based classroom methods.
* **Gamification:** The application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts (like a classroom) to improve user engagement.
